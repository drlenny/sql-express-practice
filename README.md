# sql-express-practice

We'll be using the same databases from previous exercises to create API endpoints. We'll also be doing some work on different branches to help us practice git.

## Round 1

For this round, you can stay here on the `main` branch

<!-- 1. Create a GET endpoint that returns all Users -->
<!-- 2. Create a GET endpoint that returns all Comments -->
3. Create a POST endpoint that allows you to create a User
4. Create a POST endpoint that allows you to create a Comment
5. Create a PUT endpoint that allows you to update a User
6. Create a PUT endpoint that allows you to update a Comment
7. Create a GET endpoint that allows you to retrieve a User's Comments

## Round 2

For this round, switch to the `apis/classroom` branch

1. Create an endpoint to retrieve all Classes
2. Create an endpoint to retrieve all Students
3. Create an endpoint to retrieve all Teachers
4. Create an endpoint to retrieve all Students given a specific Class ID
5. Create an endpoint to retrieve all Classes given a specific Teacher ID
6. Create an endpoint to retrieve a single Class given a specific ID
7. Create an endpoint to retrieve a single Student given a specific ID

#### Bonus

1. Modify your endpoint in Question 6 by also adding a list of Students that belong to the class in a `students` key 


## Round 3

For this round, switch to the `apis/food` branch

1. Create a full set of CRUD endpoints to 
   1. Create a specific item in the `food_des` table
   2. Read a specific item from the `food_des` table
   3. Update a specific item in the `food_des` table
   4. Delete a specific item in the `food_des` table
2. Create an endpoint to fetch all items in the `fd_group` table
3. Create an endpoint to fetch a single item in the `fd_group` given an `fdgrp_cd` 
4. Modify the endpoint in #3 to return a list of foods that belong to the food group
